# ML-codon-usage
In this project me and my college classmates made an analysis of different models to predict to which family an organisms belongs by looking at their codons (pieces of genetical information). In CodonUsage you may find the code of all models each with an optimization, we also crated another corpus by doing clustering using the k means method and did the analysis on both corpus.
